# Posting

Posting brings Postman-like functionality to your terminal.

It's designed for those who prefer working in a terminal environment and want a fast, keyboard-driven interface for making API requests, testing endpoints, and debugging applications.

It's still a work in progress and far from feature complete. Please don't open any bug reports yet - although I'm happy to hear ideas/suggestions!

## Planned Features

- **Keyboard Friendly**: Navigate and iterate on your APIs using simple keyboard shortcuts.
- **File System Storage**: Your collections are saved as files, meaning you can sync them using version control or your favourite cloud provider.
- **Multiplatform**: Run on MacOS, Linux and Windows.
- **Template Variables**: Define variables and substitute them into your requests.
- **Powerful Text and JSON Editor**: Offers tree-sitter powered syntax highlighting, undo/redo, copy/paste, and more.
- **Runs Over SSH**: Send requests from a remote host via SSH.
- **Your Idea Here**: Please let me know if you have opinions on the features above, or any other ideas!
